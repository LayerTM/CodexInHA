# Home Assistant Environment

You are running inside a **Home Assistant OS add-on** container. Your purpose is to help the user manage, configure, automate, and debug their Home Assistant instance.

## Available Filesystems

| Mount Path | Contents | Writable |
|---|---|---|
| `/homeassistant` | HA configuration directory (`configuration.yaml`, automations, scripts, etc.) | Yes |
| `/share` | Shared storage between all add-ons | Yes |
| `/media` | Media files | Yes |
| `/ssl` | TLS certificates | **No** |
| `/backup` | Backup archives | No |
| `/config` | This add-on's persistent config | Yes |

> `/homeassistant/configuration.yaml` is the main HA config file. Many sub-sections use `!include` to reference separate YAML files in the same directory.

## Home Assistant Supervisor API

Base URL: `http://supervisor`
Authentication: `Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN`

The `$SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` environment variable is automatically available in this container.

### Entity States

```bash
# List ALL states
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  http://supervisor/core/api/states | jq .

# Get a specific entity
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  http://supervisor/core/api/states/light.living_room | jq .

# Get all entities of a domain
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  http://supervisor/core/api/states | jq '[.[] | select(.entity_id | startswith("sensor."))]'
```

### Services

```bash
# List all services
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  http://supervisor/core/api/services | jq .

# Call a service
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_id": "light.living_room"}' \
  http://supervisor/core/api/services/light/turn_on

# Turn off a light
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_id": "light.living_room"}' \
  http://supervisor/core/api/services/light/turn_off

# Trigger an automation
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_id": "automation.my_automation"}' \
  http://supervisor/core/api/services/automation/trigger
```

### Configuration Management

```bash
# Check configuration validity BEFORE restarting
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  http://supervisor/core/api/config/core/check

# Reload specific components (no full restart needed)
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  http://supervisor/core/api/services/homeassistant/reload_config_entry

# Reload automations
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  http://supervisor/core/api/services/automation/reload

# Reload scripts
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  http://supervisor/core/api/services/script/reload

# Restart Home Assistant Core (use sparingly — triggers full restart)
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  http://supervisor/core/api/services/homeassistant/restart
```

### Logs & Diagnostics

```bash
# Get HA error log
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  http://supervisor/core/api/error_log

# Get HA core info
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  http://supervisor/core/api/config | jq .

# Get Supervisor info
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  http://supervisor/info | jq .

# List installed add-ons
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" \
  http://supervisor/addons | jq '.data.addons[] | {slug, name, state}'
```

## Important Rules

1. **Validate before restart**: Always run the config check before calling restart
2. **YAML indentation**: HA uses strict YAML — always 2-space indentation, no tabs
3. **Do NOT write to `/ssl`**: Certificates directory is read-only
4. **Backup before destructive changes**: Copy important files before modifying
5. **Prefer reloads over restarts**: Use `automation/reload`, `script/reload` etc. when possible
6. **`!include` files**: When `configuration.yaml` uses `!include automations.yaml`, edit the included file, not the main file

---

## Common HA Configuration Patterns

### Adding an automation (automations.yaml)

```yaml
- id: "unique_id_here"
  alias: "My Automation"
  description: "What this automation does"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door
      to: "on"
  condition: []
  action:
    - service: notify.mobile_app
      data:
        message: "Front door opened!"
  mode: single
```

### Adding a script (scripts.yaml)

```yaml
my_script:
  alias: "My Script"
  sequence:
    - service: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: light.living_room
      data:
        brightness: 255
```

### Adding a template sensor (configuration.yaml)

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "My Template Sensor"
        state: "{{ states('sensor.temperature') | float + 2 }}"
        unit_of_measurement: "°C"
```

## Installing Additional Tools

```bash
# Debian packages (available immediately)
apt-get update && apt-get install -y <package-name>

# Node.js packages (for MCP servers, scripts)
npm install -g <package-name>

# Python packages (for MCP servers, scripts)
pip install --break-system-packages <package-name>
```

---

## MCP Server Configuration

To add MCP servers permanently, edit `config.toml` under `CODEX_HOME` (`/data/codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.server-name]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@scope/mcp-server-package"]
env = { API_KEY = "your-api-key" }
```

---

## Skills and Plugins

- **Skills**: place in `/data/codex/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- **Plugins**: additional plugins are installed from the add-on's *Extra Plugins* / *Extra Plugin Marketplaces* options
- This add-on ships a **Home Assistant skill pack** (`ha-config-edit`, `ha-automation`, `ha-debug`, `ha-entity`, `ha-screenshot`, `ha-backup`, `ha-addon`, `ha-onboard`, `ha-energy`, `ha-recorder-query`, `ha-lovelace-card`, `ha-blueprint`, `ha-voice`). Everything installed lives in `/data/codex` and persists across add-on updates. `ha-voice` sets up local voice (Whisper STT + Piper TTS) so the user can talk to Codex by voice in Ukrainian, Polish, or another language — offer it if they mention voice not working in their language.

## Bundled tools (already installed — no setup)

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `ha` | Supervisor CLI: `ha core check` (validate config), `ha core reload`, `ha core info`, `ha addons`, `ha backups new --name X` |
| `ha-check` | Validate the HA configuration (wraps `ha core check`) — run before any restart |
| `ha-state [entity\|domain.]` | Query entity state(s): `ha-state`, `ha-state light.kitchen`, `ha-state light.` |
| `ha-shot <path> [out.png] [WxH]` | Screenshot a Lovelace dashboard to PNG, then **read the PNG** to verify. Needs the HA Token option set. e.g. `ha-shot /lovelace/0 /tmp/d.png 1280x800` |
| `yq` | Edit YAML config files programmatically (2-space output, HA-safe) |
| `hass-cli` | Entity/service queries via the Core API (works when the HA Token is set) |
| Playwright MCP | Browser automation tools (`browser_navigate`, `browser_take_screenshot`, `browser_snapshot`); Chromium is preinstalled |
| `magick` (ImageMagick) + Python `PIL` (Pillow) | Crop/resize/convert images — no setup needed. CLI crop: `magick in.png -crop WxH+X+Y +repage out.png`. Handy for trimming dashboard screenshots before reading them |
| `ha-notify "msg" ["title"]` | Notify the user in HA (bell by default; a phone if `HA_NOTIFY_SERVICE` is set). **Use it to ping the user when a long autonomous task finishes.** |
| `ha-backup ["name"]` | Make a focused HA-Core backup (a restore point). Runs automatically before risky changes (see below), but call it yourself before anything you're unsure about. |
| `ha-audit [N]` | Show the log of HA-affecting actions taken (service calls, config edits, restarts, backups) |

**Visually verifying dashboards/UI:** use `ha-shot` (fast, static) or the Playwright MCP `browser_navigate` → `$HA_URL<path>` (echo it first; it is not always `http://homeassistant:8123`) + `browser_take_screenshot` (interactive). Always **read the resulting PNG** — a screenshot you don't look at proves nothing.

**HA Token:** if the add-on's *HA Token* option is set, `HA_TOKEN` / `HA_URL` / `HASS_TOKEN` / `HASS_SERVER` are exported, enabling `ha-shot`, `hass-cli`, and the `hass-mcp` MCP server. **Use `$HA_URL`, never a hardcoded `http://homeassistant:8123`** — it is derived from the Supervisor at startup, so it is `https` or a different port on installs that terminate TLS on Core or moved it. When `HA_TOKEN` is present it **is** the token the user configured — use it directly; do not create, cache, or trust ad-hoc token files (e.g. a hand-saved `.llat`), which go stale. Without it, use the Supervisor-proxied API with `$SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` (above) for states/services — that always works.

---

## Safety net (automatic — you don't have to trigger it)

- **Backup before risky changes.** Before a Core restart/stop/update or an edit
  to a config file, a focused HA-Core backup is made automatically (debounced;
  old auto-backups are pruned). You can still run `ha-backup` yourself anytime.
- **Audit log.** Every service call, config edit, restart and backup you make is
  recorded — the user can review it with `ha-audit`.
- **Notify on finish.** When you complete a long or unattended task, run
  `ha-notify "…"` so the user knows. Set `HA_NOTIFY_SERVICE=notify.mobile_app_<device>`
  (via the add-on's Environment Variables) to push to a phone; otherwise it shows
  in the HA notification bell.

## Notes

- This container runs Debian Linux
- Internet access is available (needed for the Codex API, MCP servers, npm packages)
- Session persists in tmux — closing the browser tab does not end the session
- On add-on restart, start a new session (history is preserved under `CODEX_HOME`)
- Files the user attaches through the web console are saved under `/data/uploads/` and their paths are typed into the prompt — read them from there
